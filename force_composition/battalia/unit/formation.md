## Changing Formation
Changing Formation takes one entire move order.  Units may only Change Formation once in each **Command Phase**.

### Skirmish Formation
**Units** that come in contact with otherwise impassible terrain must **Change Formation** into **Skirmish Formation** before continuing through the terrain.

Units with the **Skirmish Special Rule** that **Change Formation** to OR from **Skirmish Formation** have the option to make an additional NON-**CHARGE** move for the cost of one entire move order.

### Warband Special Rule
This rule only relates to **Changing Formation**.

 1. **Column**: A **Unit** with the **Warband Special Rule** may only **Change Formation** to **Column Formation** if it is on a road.  If a **Unit** with the **Warband Special Rule** is in **Column Formation** and it is not on a road, its next move MUST be to **Change Formation** to **Battle Line Formation**.
 1. **Skirmish Formation**: A **Unit** with the **Warband Special Rule** may only **Change Formation** to **Skirmish Formation** if it comes into contact with otherwise impassible terrain.  If a **Unit** with the **Warband Special Rule** is in **Skirmish Formation** and leaves the terrain that obliged it to **Change Formation** to **Skirmish Formation**, its next move MUST be to **Change Formation** to **Battle Line Formation**.

### Buildings
**Units** occupying a building have no formation.
